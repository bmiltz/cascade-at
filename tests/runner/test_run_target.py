"""
These tests represent the different ways we launch the Cascade.
It's TDD, but working from a very high level for the code.
There are three backends:

 1. Under Grid Engine (UGE, SGE), because this is what we use for production.
 2. As multiple processes, for analysis work done by modelers on laptop
    or a single node on the cluster.
 3. As one process, calling each part of the code as a function, because
    this is used to debug. You see it in Dismod-ODE code as an if-then
    that skips using multiprocessing.

The other key is to be able to run parts of the whole Cascade.
The whole cascade_at is constructed from these parts:

 * There is one **estimation** at each location of the location hierarchy.
 * Each estimation contains three kinds of stages,
   the **fit**, around 30 **simulation fits**, and one **summary**.

The modelers have discussed wanting to run portions of a total
Cascade. These are the portions they have listed so far.

 1. Run everything, known as a **global run**.
 2. Run the **drill**, which is all stages for an estimation and its parent
    estimations.
 3. Run all stages for **part of a drill**. For instance, run one estimation,
    so that we can debug how to improve the model for one estimation.
 4. Run every estimation that depends on a given one. This is a
    **subtree** of the location hierarchy.

Lastly, restarting is a common occurrence, which means finishing
those parts that are unfinished.

The tests here will use fakes for the implementation inside of
the stages, requested by using "--mock-stage". They will also
use a stub for settings, because we care about only one or two
parameters from the settings.
